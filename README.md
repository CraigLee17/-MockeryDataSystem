# Mockery Data System

## Outline
This system is used to mock your back-end API by providing realistic data and endpoint access.

## Why you need this?
* Test data is a vital requirement throughout the entire development of any web application.
* The data must be real; not in the sense of the data having any type of semantic correlation to the external world; but real in the sense of its syntactic structure and internal references.
* Generating this data can be a time-consuming process that is subject to a great deal of change, especially early in the software development cycle.
* This tool provides you real supported back-end.
* It lets you focusing on developing UI prototype more faster and interacting with mock data much simpler.
* By making real requests to mock back-end, you'll uncover problems with application flow, timing, and API design early, improving the quality of both API and the user experience. 

## Tech Stack: [MEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle))
* [**M**ongoose.js](http://www.mongoosejs.com) ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)): database
* [**E**xpress.js](http://expressjs.com): backend framework
* [**A**ngular 5+](https://angular.io): frontend framework
* [**N**ode.js](https://nodejs.org): runtime environment

Other tools and technologies used:
* [Mocker-data-generator](https://github.com/danibram/mocker-data-generator) data generator
* [Bootstrap 4](http://www.getbootstrap.com): layout and styles
* [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/docs): user authentication
* [Bcrypt-nodejs](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js): password encryption

## Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

## Running in Docker Container
* Install git
* Clone the Project to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/CraigLee17/mockeryData.git`
* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
* Run the following commands from project root directory
* `cd server`
* `docker-compose up`

## Future thoughts:
* Mix user data with mock data. Alow users to append data with Mockery data. (In Machine learning area, mock data can be used to validated model. Expecting True Negative result with mock input data in an ideal model)
* Derive metadata of the mock data with Spark. (Provide deeper insight into the data to users)
* Generate mock data based on a REST endpoint for visitors. e.g. /api/v1/visitors/{dataTypeName}?amount=100

## Advanced Topics
* **Scaling**: [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2), a handy process manager to spin up multiple node instances in a multiple-cores machine. Out of the box, PM2 includes supports for load-balancing, monitoring and log managment.
* **In-memory Cache**: [Redis](https://redis.io), frequent use sample data can be stored in memory.

* you have any suggestion to improve this project
* you notice any problems or errors
