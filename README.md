# Mockery Data System

## Outline
This system is used to mock your back-end API by providing realistic data and endpoint access.

## Why you need this?
* Test data is a vital requirement throughout the entire development of any web application.
* The data must be real; not in the sense of the data having any type of semantic correlation to the external world; but real in the sense of its syntactic structure and internal references.
* Generating this data can be a time-consuming process that is subject to a great deal of change, especially early in the software development cycle.
* This tool provides you real supported back-end.
* It lets you focusing on developing UI prototype more faster and interacting with mock data much simpler.
* By making real requests to mock back-end, you'll uncover problems with application flow, timing, and API design early, improving the quality of both API and the user experience.
